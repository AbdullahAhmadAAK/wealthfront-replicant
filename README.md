**Backend Repo: WealthFlare Replicant (Backend)**

**Project Description:**

The client asked me to replicate a full-stack feature from a website, focusing on building out the backend. I took on this challenge while being out of work, hoping it would lead to something substantial. Unfortunately, it turned out to be an unpaid test assignment with no promise of future compensation. After completing the backend and preparing detailed work documentation (including sharing repositories), the client never responded to any of my follow-ups.

While the project didn’t result in any financial gain, it served as a catalyst to reignite my development drive. It also reinforced a valuable lesson: never take on unpaid test projects. I am qualified, I’ve done the work, and I will never accept less than what I am worth. Pay me fairly, ser, and watch me do wonders for your project.
